# Splunk Observability Synthetics Setup

Focused wrapper for Synthetic Monitoring. It renders a native-ops compatible
spec and operator handoffs; API-backed create/update and run retrieval remain
owned by `splunk-observability-native-ops`.

## Workflow

```bash
bash skills/splunk-observability-synthetics-setup/scripts/setup.sh --render \
  --name "Checkout browser journey" \
  --kind browser \
  --url https://shop.example.com/checkout \
  --realm us1 \
  --location aws-us-east-1
```

Review `native-ops-spec.json`, then delegate render/apply through:

```bash
bash splunk-observability-synthetics-rendered/delegate-native-ops.sh
```

Use this skill for discoverability and focused planning. Use
`splunk-observability-native-ops` directly when the user already has a complete
multi-surface Observability spec.
