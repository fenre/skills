- OS family: `{platform.get('os_family', 'linux')}`

## Recommended Path

{selected_lines}

## Supported Classic Paths

- Express GUI: fastest first-run path for a single-host Controller and embedded Events Service.
- Custom GUI: production path for distributed hosts, HA Controller, and scaled Events Service.
- Enterprise Console CLI: reviewed repeatable path for Linux operators; this skill renders command plans but omits direct password arguments.
- Discover and Upgrade GUI or CLI: onboarding path for existing Controllers and Events Service instances.
- AWS Aurora Controller upgrade or move: CLI-only branch when the existing Controller database is Aurora.

## Frictionless Intake

Ask only these fields first: deployment model, install mode, operator interface, target version, Controller profile, Enterprise Console host, Controller primary host, and whether Events/EUM/Synthetic are in scope. Defer advanced ports, HA, certificates, and component-specific fields until the selected path requires them.

## Guardrails

- Enterprise Console is required for Controller and Events Service lifecycle.
- For Windows Controller targets, Enterprise Console must run on the same Windows machine because remote Windows operations are not supported through Enterprise Console.
- Use PEM-format SSH keys for Enterprise Console remote host credentials.
- Keep Controller, MySQL, Enterprise Console, and Events credentials file-backed; the renderer does not put password values in shell arguments.

Documentation baseline: AppDynamics On-Premises {doc_version}.

## Install Inputs

- Platform: `{platform.get('name', 'prod-platform')}`
- Controller primary host: `{controller.get('primary_host', 'controller-1.example.com')}`
- Controller secondary host: `{controller.get('secondary_host', 'not configured')}`
- Controller profile: `{platform.get('controller_profile', 'medium')}`
- Controller URL: `{spec.get('controller_url', 'https://controller.example.com:8090')}`
- Backup location: `{controller.get('backup_location', as_dict(spec.get('ha')).get('backup_location', 'not configured'))}`

## Required File-Backed Secrets

- Controller admin password file: `{controller.get('admin_password_file', 'missing')}`
- Controller root password file: `{controller.get('root_password_file', 'missing')}`
- MySQL root password file: `{controller.get('mysql_root_password_file', 'missing')}`
- Controller database user password file: `{controller.get('database_user_password_file', 'missing')}`

## Operator Steps

1. Verify Enterprise Console is installed and `platform-admin.sh show-platform-admin-version` reports the expected {doc_version} family.
2. Review `enterprise-console-hosts.txt`; every Controller and Events Service host must be reachable from the Enterprise Console host.
3. Run `enterprise-console-command-plan.sh` only after an authenticated Enterprise Console CLI session exists.
4. Use `list-job-parameters --service controller --job install` before constructing the local install command.
5. Construct the Controller install job outside this rendered tree because the 26.4 CLI requires password arguments for Controller install.
6. After install, run `platform-validation-probes.sh`; then verify Controller startup, Controller login, and database health.

## Upgrade Guardrails

- Back up the Controller before any upgrade.
- Confirm the current and target Enterprise Console and Controller versions.
- For HA, validate secondary license readiness and HA replication before starting.
- Events Service enabled: `{bool(events.get('enabled', False))}`. Validate Events Service health before and after Controller upgrades.
- Recheck retained Controller configuration changes after upgrade.

## Recommended Component Paths

{selected_lines}

## Events Service

- Linux: Enterprise Console supports GUI or CLI install, embedded-to-scaled conversion, and 1-node or 3+ node deployments.
- Windows: use a manual Events Service runbook. Enterprise Console does not support remote Windows operations, so do not render a remote-install flow.
- Clustered Events Service should use internal DNS/IPs, a load balancer VIP, open node ports, and host tuning before install.

## EUM Server

- EUM Server is not installed by Enterprise Console.
- Supported installer modes are GUI, console, and silent mode with a varfile.
- Demo mode shares the Controller host and MySQL; production mode uses a separate host and its own MySQL instance.
- Production should normally terminate HTTPS at a reverse proxy.

## Synthetic Server

- Gate Synthetic work behind Controller, Events Service, and EUM readiness.
- Validate Synthetic Server to EUM and Controller connectivity before adding Synthetic Agents.
- Keep Synthetic endpoint, certificate, and agent rollout checks in a separate maintenance step.

## Checks

- Confirm the primary and secondary hosts meet the HA prerequisites before pairing.
- Confirm backup artifacts exist and are restorable before upgrade or failover.
- Confirm the load balancer health check targets the active Controller only.
- Confirm failover, rollback, and DNS/LB ownership are assigned to named operators.
- Restore and HA cutover steps remain operator-run runbooks; this skill does not automate failover.

## Current Selection

- Infrastructure platform: `{va.get('infrastructure_platform', 'vmware_vsphere')}`
- Service deployment: `{va.get('service_deployment', 'standard')}`
- Profile: `{profile}`
- Node count: `{va.get('node_count', 3)}`
- Image file: `{va.get('image_file', 'download from Virtual Appliance tab')}`
- DNS domain: `{va.get('dns_domain', 'not configured')}`

## Recommended Path

{selected_lines}

## Infrastructure Targets

- VMware vSphere: deploy three VMs from OVA/OVF, set OVF properties for host name, host IP/subnet, gateway, DNS, and domain, enable VMware Tools OVF environment, then run `appdctl show boot` on every node.
- VMware ESXi: deploy three VMs from the OVA, configure datastore/network/host fields, run `sudo appdctl host init` when prompted for ESXi host details, then verify boot status.
- Azure: use the VHD image, create or reuse resource group, NSG, VNet, storage, disk, image gallery, image version, then create three VMs.
- AWS: use the AMI import path, VPC, S3 image bucket, IAM import role, snapshot/register steps, then create three m5a.4xlarge instances unless sizing guidance changes.
- KVM: use QCOW2 and reference scripts; preflight NTP, `/dev/kvm`, bridge, storage pool, and config.cfg.
- ROSA: use ROSA HCP with OpenShift Virtualization, upload QCOW2 to PVCs with `virtctl`, create three RHEL-template VMs, and configure firewall/NLB.

## VMware OVA Automation Packet

The renderer emits these VMware-specific files for vSphere and standalone ESXi handoff:

- `virtual-appliance-vmware-inventory.yaml`: redacted infrastructure, OVA, node, network, and secret-file references.
- `virtual-appliance-ovftool-plan.sh`: dry-run OVF Tool import commands. It omits the VMware password from shell arguments and lets OVF Tool prompt unless an operator chooses a local wrapper.
- `virtual-appliance-govc-plan.sh`: dry-run govc import flow that can read the VMware password from a chmod-600 file only when `VMWARE_APPLY=1`.
- `virtual-appliance-vmware-validation.sh`: static node checks, default pod-CIDR overlap warnings, optional govc VM inventory probes, and optional SSH `appdctl show boot` checks.

Do not send the OVA through chat. Place it on the workstation or automation host that has OVF Tool or govc installed, set `virtual_appliance.image_file`, and run the dry-run scripts first. The official VMware Virtual Appliance pages currently expose 25.10 URL paths; pair them with the 26.4 On-Premises platform docs for Enterprise Console and Controller lifecycle work.

## Service Deployment

- Standard: install infrastructure and Splunk AppDynamics services in the appliance Kubernetes cluster.
- Hybrid: connect to existing classic Controller, Events Service, and EUM components, then install add-on services in the appliance cluster.
- Match `appdcli start <service> <profile>` to the VM profile selected during infrastructure deployment.
- Validate with `appdctl show boot`, `appdctl show cluster`, `microk8s status`, `appdcli ping`, and `kubectl get pods -A`.

## Frictionless Intake

For Virtual Appliance, ask for platform, standard vs hybrid, profile, DNS domain, three node IPs, gateway, DNS server, image format/file, certificate preference, and license file readiness. Only ask cloud-specific fields after the user chooses Azure, AWS, KVM, vSphere, ESXi, or ROSA.

Use this first. It keeps intake to the smallest set of decisions needed to pick
the right Smart Agent workflow.

## Current Selection

- Controller: `{spec.get('controller_url', 'https://example.saas.appdynamics.com')}`
- Account: `{spec.get('account_name', 'customer1')}`
- Operator mode: `{spec.get('operator_mode', 'render')}`
- Package source: `{smart_agent.get('package_source', 'download_portal')}`
- Remote install enabled: `{bool(remote.get('enabled', smart_agent.get('remote_execution', False)))}`
- Remote execution accepted: `{bool(smart_agent.get('remote_execution', False))}`
- Deployment groups enabled: `{bool(deployment_groups.get('enabled', False))}`
- Auto-attach enabled: `{bool(auto_attach.get('enabled', smart_agent.get('enable_auto_attach', False)))}`
- Auto-discovery enabled: `{bool(auto_discovery.get('enabled', smart_agent.get('run_auto_discovery', True)))}`

## Pick The Path

1. Use the Agent Management UI when the user wants guided install, upgrade, or
   rollback and Smart Agent is already registered on the target hosts.
2. Use `smartagentctl` when the user needs repeatable reviewed commands, remote
   host operations, local-directory packages, custom HTTP sources, or service vs
   process control.
3. Use deployment groups when the user needs the same agent configuration across
   many Smart Agent hosts.
4. Use auto-attach only for Java and Node.js runtimes. Treat it as an app owner
   change because process restart and naming rules affect runtime behavior.
5. Use auto-discovery to find Java, .NET, Node.js, and Python processes before
   selecting an install action.
6. Use the deprecated standalone Smart Agent CLI only to maintain a legacy
   build-time workflow; new work should prefer Smart Agent UI or `smartagentctl`.

## Target Hosts

{target_lines}

## Smart Agent Inventory

1. Navigate to Home > Agent Management > Manage Agents.
2. Use the Smart Agents tab to confirm every target host is registered.
3. Select one or more Smart Agent hosts before clicking Install Agent when you
   want the install page to preselect those hosts.

## App Server And Machine Agent Install

1. Click Install Agent.
2. Select the agent type.
3. Choose Select from List for registered Smart Agent hosts or Import from CSV
   when host selection must be bulk-loaded.
4. Confirm the install directory, package source, and custom configuration.
5. For Machine Agent on SELinux, review the SELinux permissive-mode note before
   install.

## Upgrade

- Stop Machine Agent extension processes before upgrading Machine Agent.
- Keep enough free space: Java or Machine Agent upgrade paths may require temp
  and current directories sized relative to the agent zip.
- For older Smart Agent managed Java installs, place `java.zip` or
  `machine.zip` in the agent directory when the zip is not already present.

## Rollback

- UI rollback is available only after the agent has been upgraded through the
  UI at least once.
- Rollback returns only to the last used version.

## Database Agent

- Database Agent can be managed through UI only when Smart Agent is installed
  on the same machine.
- Database Agent high availability is not supported through Agent Management.
- Windows Database Agent management requires Controller 25.10.0, Database Agent
  25.9.0, and Smart Agent 25.10.0 or later.
- Database Agent rollback retains JVM arguments from the rolled-back version.

Deployment groups are the lowest-friction path for repeatable large-scale

auto-attach from one location, then apply that configuration to selected Smart
Agent hosts.

## Operations

- Create: define enabled agents, per-agent configuration, optional auto-attach,
  and the target Smart Agent hosts.
- Update hosts: change only the selected host set when configuration should
  stay stable.
- Edit: change agent versions, configuration, or auto-attach settings.
- Duplicate: create a staged variant before modifying production settings.
- Delete: remove only after confirming there are no hosts that still depend on
  the group template.
- View: use this as the validation path before and after rollout.

## Guardrails

- Keep one deployment group per coherent application/runtime pattern.
- Do not mix Windows-only .NET targets with Linux-only Apache/PHP/Python targets
  in the same group unless the UI explicitly supports the resulting host set.
- Use canary Smart Agent hosts before broad assignment.

## Auto-Attach

- Scope: Java and Node.js only.
- Java runtimes and frameworks: Tomcat, WebLogic, Spring Boot, JBoss,
  GlassFish, and plain Java applications.
- Node.js is supported for auto-attach on documented supported platforms.
- Default file: `<SmartAgent directory>/lib/ld_preload.json`.
- Java agent path: `{java_path}`.
- Node.js agent path: `{node_path}`.
- Use custom `ld_preload.json` filters when an app owner wants to exclude
  processes, bind a specific Java Agent path to a service, or generate
  application, tier, and node names from environment variables.

## Auto-Discovery

- Smart Agent 24.4 or later can report supported application processes.
- Discovered process coverage: Java on Windows/Linux, .NET on Windows, Node.js
  on Linux, and Python on Linux.
- RunAutoDiscovery: `{bool(auto_discovery.get('enabled', True))}`.
- Excluded labels: `{as_list(auto_discovery.get('exclude_labels')) or ['process.cpu.usage', 'process.memory.usage']}`.
- Excluded processes: `{as_list(auto_discovery.get('exclude_processes'))}`.
- Excluded users: `{as_list(auto_discovery.get('exclude_users'))}`.

## Validation

1. Confirm discovered processes appear in the Controller process inventory.
2. Confirm selected process routing maps to the intended agent type.
3. For auto-attach, restart only within an app owner approved window.
4. Confirm Controller node registration, naming, tier placement, and metrics.

The standalone Smart Agent CLI is deprecated in the 26.4 documentation and has
a documented end-of-support date of February 2, 2026. Treat it as legacy-only;
new work should use the Agent Management UI or `smartagentctl`.

Use this path only for legacy build-time workflows that already depend on the
standalone CLI.

## Compatibility Notes

- The deprecated CLI can manage remote or local nodes through a standalone
  service.
- It does not support Database Agent.
- Multiple-node Smart Agent install through this CLI requires Python 3.10 or
  later.
- Existing automation should be migrated toward `smartagentctl` command plans
  and `remote.yaml` templates.

## Legacy Examples

```bash
./appd install smartagent --install-agent-from ARTIFACT_PATH --inventory HOSTS --connection ssh --auto-start
appd configure smartagent --attach-configure-file PATH_TO_LD_PRELOAD_JSON

## Scope

- Download portal packages are entitlement and permission dependent.
- Use filters by type, version, operating system, and Compatible With Controller
  for agent packages.
- Use cURL automation only with download-scoped OAuth and file-backed local
  handling. Do not place download passwords or tokens in specs, shell history,
  rendered artifacts, or chat.
- Validate digital signatures wherever Splunk AppDynamics publishes them for a
  package family.

## Required Checks

- Binary transfer mode: `{download_validation.get('transfer_mode', 'binary')}`.
- Require checksum: `{bool(download_validation.get('require_checksum', True))}`.
- Require signature where published: `{bool(download_validation.get('require_signature_if_published', True))}`.
- Require release note link: `{bool(download_validation.get('release_notes_required', True))}`.
- Require rollback package: `{bool(download_validation.get('rollback_package_required', True))}`.

## Validation

1. Record package name, version, operating system, compatible Controller version,
   source URL, and release-note link.
2. Compare MD5 and SHA256 checksums after download.
3. Verify digital signatures and code signatures for .NET Agent and Windows MSI packages where
   published.
4. Verify PGP signatures for Java Agent, Machine Agent, Machine Agent RPM, and
   Python Agent pip package where published.
5. Confirm rollback packages are available before upgrade.

## Controller 26.4 Enhancements

- Supported agents can automatically release licenses to the pool when disabled
  and reacquire licenses when re-enabled. This is support-gated; confirm the
  feature flag with Cisco Support before using disable/enable as a license
  balancing operation.
- Agent Upgrade API support is in scope for upgrade workflows. Use
  `agent-upgrade-api-plan.sh` for a reviewed API shape and keep OAuth tokens
  file-backed.
- Machine Agent permissions now support tag-based access control for View Agent
  and Edit Agent permissions. Coordinate with `splunk-appdynamics-controller-admin-setup`
  for role readbacks and avoid granting full admin privileges for machine-only
  operations.

## Agent Release Notes

- Private Synthetic Agent 26.4 adds Podman deployment, Chrome Headful mode, a
  StorageClass creation flag for Kubernetes file management, and Chrome 147.
- Python Agent 26.4 adds Python 3.14 support and deprecates Python 3.8; 26.4.1
  includes RHEL 8 amd64 and library updates.
- Cluster Agent 26.4 adds enhanced Kubernetes event visibility when K8s alerting
  is enabled.
- Database Agent 26.4 adds PostgreSQL Blocking Session support, MongoDB
  QueryExecutor metrics, Microsoft SQL Server 2025 support, and dual DB2 driver
  behavior based on JRE level.
- Network Agent and Analytics Agent 26.4 are mostly library and bug-fix

## Enhanced Kubernetes Event Visibility

- Cluster Agent 26.4 adds enhanced visibility for Kubernetes events when
  Kubernetes alerting is enabled.
- Validate that Controller-side Kubernetes alerting is enabled before expecting
  event enrichment in the UI.
- Review namespace scoping before broad event collection; this renderer uses
  `{collector['namespace']}` as the Cluster Agent namespace and keeps workload
  targets explicit.

## Component Upgrade Checks

- Confirm Cluster Agent, Operator, and Splunk OTel Collector compatibility
  before upgrade.
- Validate `installSplunkOtelCollector`, O11y realm, file-backed token secret,
  OTLP service ports 4317/4318, and collector logs after rollout.
- If GPU monitoring is enabled through Cluster Agent, coordinate rollout with
  `splunk-appdynamics-infrastructure-visibility-setup` and the broader NVIDIA
  or Cisco AI Pod observability skills.

## Rendered Coverage

- Cluster Agent deploys through the AppDynamics Helm chart with `installSplunkOtelCollector` set from the spec.
- Splunk OTel Collector is configured for realm `{collector['realm']}`, environment `{collector['environment']}`, and cluster `{collector['cluster_name']}`.
- O11y access tokens stay file-backed. Runtime apply uses `--set-file` or a Kubernetes Secret generated from `SPLUNK_O11Y_ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE`.
- Dual-signal workload plans cover: {", ".join(languages)}.

## Workloads

{target_lines}

## Mode Guidance

- `dual`: keep AppDynamics Controller visibility and emit OpenTelemetry signals toward Splunk Observability Cloud.
- `otel`: emit OpenTelemetry signals only when Controller-side AppDynamics agent telemetry is not wanted.
- `appd-only`: keep Controller telemetry and skip O11y export for that workload.
- `collector` export is the default because it centralizes O11y token use in the collector.
- `direct` export is available for constrained environments, but it mounts the O11y token into the workload through a Kubernetes Secret.

## Language Notes

- Java combined agent: use `AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=dual` with OTLP exporter variables and service/resource attributes.
- .NET Core Linux combined mode is rendered with the startup hook variables required by the combined .NET agent path.
- Node.js combined mode uses `AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=dual` plus OTLP exporter variables; application packaging must include the AppDynamics Node.js agent runtime.
- Machine Agent combined mode is acknowledged for infrastructure use cases; broad host/node rollout belongs in `splunk-appdynamics-infrastructure-visibility-setup`.

## Handoffs

- Deep Splunk OTel Collector tuning, gateway sizing, processors, and enterprise O11y dashboards can delegate to `splunk-observability-otel-collector-setup`.
- APM model ownership remains in `splunk-appdynamics-apm-setup`.
