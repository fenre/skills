## API Basis

The API basis is Cisco Workflows / Meraki Automation API readiness, not direct
Cisco Cloud Control platform mutation. The renderer writes
`api/workflows-api-readiness.md` with the public REST path pattern, bearer
authentication model, OAS requirement, target/account-key model, and published
run-rate limits. Direct Cisco Cloud Control Admin Console, Cloud Control Studio,
and AI Canvas writes remain operator handoffs.

## Product Boundary

Cisco Cloud Control is distinct from Cisco Security Cloud Control, formerly
Cisco Defense Orchestrator. The product router therefore exposes
`cisco_cloud_control` as a synthetic workflow handoff while keeping
`cisco_security_cloud_control` as the Security Cloud Control roadmap item.
