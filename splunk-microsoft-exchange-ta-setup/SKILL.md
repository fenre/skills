# Microsoft Exchange Supported Add-on Setup

## TA Completion Gate

For every TA/add-on or dashboard companion run, satisfy the shared
[TA completion gate](../shared/ta_completion_gate.md): configure and enable the
data ingest path owned by this skill or its required companion, validate events
or metrics in the target indexes/source types, and verify any
pre-built/package-shipped dashboards are visible, macro-aligned, and returning
data. If the package ships no dashboards, record that evidence explicitly and
hand off dashboard use to the consuming app, ES/ITSI/ARI content, or readiness
doctor.

Render-first workflow for the verified Microsoft Exchange packages:

- Exchange bundle `4.1.0`, Splunkbase `3225`
- Exchange Indexes `SA-ExchangeIndex` `4.0.4`, Splunkbase `5663`

## Workflow

```bash
bash skills/splunk-microsoft-exchange-ta-setup/scripts/setup.sh --phase render \
  --index msexchange --windows-index windows --perfmon-index perfmon
```

Review `collection-placement.md`, `inputs.local.conf.template`,
`install-commands.sh`, and `validation-searches.spl`.

```bash
bash skills/splunk-microsoft-exchange-ta-setup/scripts/setup.sh --install --no-restart
```

```bash
bash skills/splunk-microsoft-exchange-ta-setup/scripts/validate.sh --index msexchange
```

Readiness handoff:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-data-source-readiness-doctor/scripts/setup.sh \
  --phase collect --source-pack microsoft_exchange
```
