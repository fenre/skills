  Install and configure the Cisco Secure Access App for Splunk
  (cisco-cloud-security). Supports org account creation, investigate index,
  private app index, and app discovery index provisioning. Use when the user
  asks about Cisco Secure Access, app ID 5558, cisco-cloud-security, or Secure Access dashboards.

# Cisco Secure Access Setup

Automates installation and core account configuration of the **Cisco Secure
Access App for Splunk** (`cisco-cloud-security`).

## Package Model

**Pull from Splunkbase first (latest version), fall back to `splunk-ta/`.**
Use the setup script with `--install` to install app ID `5558`. The shared
installer falls back to the local package
`cisco-secure-access-app-for-splunk_*.tgz` when needed.

This repo’s local package is the **App for Splunk** (`cisco-cloud-security`),
not the separate Splunkbase add-on package.

## Agent Behavior — Credentials

**The agent must NEVER ask for API keys, secrets, or tokens in chat.**

Splunk credentials are read from the project-root `credentials` file (falls
back to `~/.splunk/credentials`). If neither exists, guide the user to create
it:

```bash
bash skills/shared/scripts/setup_credentials.sh
```

For Secure Access API secrets, instruct the user to write them to temp files:

```bash
printf '%s' "the_api_key" > /tmp/secure_access_api_key && chmod 600 /tmp/secure_access_api_key
printf '%s' "the_api_secret" > /tmp/secure_access_api_secret && chmod 600 /tmp/secure_access_api_secret
```

## Environment

This app supports standalone and distributed deployments and can be used on
Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Search-tier API | `SPLUNK_SEARCH_API_URI` env var (legacy alias: `SPLUNK_URI`) |
| Cloud stack | `SPLUNK_CLOUD_STACK` for Cloud installs |
| App name | `cisco-cloud-security` |
| Splunkbase ID | `5558` |
| Credentials | Project-root `credentials` file (falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`) |
| Skill scripts | `skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/` |

## Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Install The App

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/setup.sh --install
```

### Step 2: Configure One Org Account

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/configure_account.sh \
  --org-id example-org-id \
  --base-url https://api.us.security.cisco.com \
  --timezone UTC \
  --storage-region us \
  --api-key-file /tmp/secure_access_api_key \
  --api-secret-file /tmp/secure_access_api_secret \
  --investigate-index cisco_secure_access_investigate \
  --privateapp-index cisco_secure_access_private_apps \
  --appdiscovery-index cisco_secure_access_app_discovery
```

The account configurator can auto-create the supplied indexes. The app’s own
`org_accounts` endpoint provisions the Private Apps and App Discovery modular
inputs when those indexes are provided.

If you need to discover the org ID first:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/configure_account.sh \
  --discover-org-id \
  --base-url https://api.us.security.cisco.com \
  --api-key-file /tmp/secure_access_api_key \
  --api-secret-file /tmp/secure_access_api_secret
```

### Step 3: Configure App Settings For Dashboard Readiness

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/configure_settings.sh \
  --org-id example-org-id \
  --bootstrap-roles \
  --accept-terms \
  --apply-dashboard-defaults
```

You can also configure optional dashboard-side settings such as:

- Cloudlock settings
- selected destination lists
- S3-backed dashboard indexes
- explicit refresh rate overrides

### Step 4: Validate

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

To validate one specific org:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-secure-access-setup/scripts/validate.sh --org-id example-org-id
```

## Dashboards

The app ships dashboards in the package. They appear in Splunk Web
automatically after installation.

To access them: **Apps → Cisco Secure Access App for Splunk**

**Prerequisites for dashboards to show data:**

1. Org account must be created (Step 2) so the app has a valid API connection.
2. App settings must be configured for dashboard readiness (Step 3), including
   terms acceptance and optional role bootstrap.
3. Modular inputs must be running and delivering events to the configured indexes
   (`investigate_index`, `privateapp_index`, `appdiscovery_index`).

The `--apply-dashboard-defaults` flag in Step 3 initializes the app's stored
dashboard settings (refresh rate, Cloudlock, destination lists, S3 index
wiring) so the UI starts in a consistent state rather than falling back to
defaults on first load.

On **Splunk Cloud**, dashboards are available immediately after ACS installs
the app. All post-install configuration (account creation, settings) runs over
search-tier REST.

## What This Automation Covers

The current skill automates:

- OAuth/org account creation and update
- investigate index registration
- private app index registration
- app discovery index registration
- automatic creation or update of the corresponding modular inputs
- app bootstrap steps such as terms acceptance and optional role creation
- dashboard settings, destination lists, Cloudlock settings, and S3-backed
  dashboard index wiring

## Key Learnings / Known Issues

1. **Custom API surface**: This app stores configuration through custom REST
   endpoints and KV store records rather than simple static conf edits.
2. **Core account fields move together**: `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, and `baseURL`
   are treated as a credential set.
3. **Org-aware indexes**: `privateapp_index` and `appdiscovery_index` create
   or update matching modular inputs for the same organization.
4. **Terms gate the UI**: The app UI stores a TOC acceptance record before some
   settings views become available.
5. **Dashboard defaults exist in the UI**: If no dashboard interval is stored,
   the frontend falls back to 12 hours. This skill can write those settings
   explicitly so the app is initialized consistently.
