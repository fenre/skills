# Native ITSI Workflow

The native workflow manages live ITSI objects through the ITSI REST API:

- `team`
- `entity`
- `entity_type`
- `entity_filter_rule`
- `entity_management_policies`
- `entity_management_rules`
- `data_integration_template`
- `service`
- `base_service_template`
- `kpi_base_search`
- `kpi_template`
- `kpi_threshold_template`
- `custom_threshold_windows`
- custom threshold window service/KPI links
- custom content packs through the content pack authorship API
- `notable_event_aggregation_policy`
- `event_management_state`
- `correlation_search`
- `notable_event_email_template`
- `maintenance_calendar`
- backup/restore jobs through the backup/restore interface
- `deep_dive`
- `glass_table`
- glass table icons through the icon collection API
- `home_view`
- `kpi_entity_threshold`
- `refresh_queue_job`
- `sandbox`
- `sandbox_service`
- `sandbox_sync_log`
- `upgrade_readiness_prechecks`
- `summarization`
- `summarization_feedback`
- `user_preference`

The core `entity`, `service`, service `kpis`, and `neaps` sections keep their typed convenience fields and also merge additional top-level ITSI schema fields plus `payload` into the REST body. The extended ITSI object sections are typed passthrough upserts: the skill sets `title`, `description`, `sec_grp`, and `object_type`, then merges any additional top-level keys and `payload` into the REST body. Use `payload` for exact exported ITSI schema fields when Splunk changes object shapes between ITSI versions.

## Notes

- The workflow intentionally preserves unmanaged fields and extra live KPIs instead of pruning them.
- Brownfield read-only modes are available via `setup.sh --workflow native --mode export|inventory|prune-plan`. Use `export --output exported.native.yaml --output-format yaml` to generate a native YAML skeleton from live ITSI, `inventory` for object/app/KV Store counts plus supported-object/alias/notable-action/entity-discovery discovery, and `prune-plan` to list unmanaged live objects without deleting them. Export skips managed/default NEAPs by default because preview/apply/validate intentionally protect them; set `export.include_managed_neaps: true` only when an operator needs those objects in an audit export. Export and prune-plan skip optional ITSI route families that are not exposed by the live host and report warning diagnostics/unavailable sections instead of aborting the whole run.
- `inventory.use_count_endpoints: true` records documented REST count-endpoint totals alongside listed objects, and `inventory.count_only: true` uses those count endpoints without collecting titles for large estates. Normal inventory/prune scans request only lightweight identity/source fields where the route supports field projections. `inventory.maintenance_object_keys` adds read-only active/window-count checks for specific live service or entity keys. `inventory.entity_discovery_entity_keys` reads the documented entity-discovery-searches route for specific live entities. `inventory.notable_event_group_filter` and `inventory.notable_event_filter` are passed to Event Management count/read endpoints when the host exposes them; set `inventory.list_notable_events: true`, `inventory.notable_event_limit`, and `inventory.notable_event_fields` for bounded notable-event readback. `inventory.notable_event_action_names`, `inventory.ticket_episode_keys`, `inventory.episode_export_filter`, `inventory.episode_export_keys`, and `inventory.templatize_objects` add read-only action-detail, ticket, export, and template-generation coverage. Inventory also reports the `entity/count_retirable` target list/count when the live host exposes it.
- `bulk_apply.enabled: true` is an opt-in native apply mode for large estates. It batches eligible existing keyed updates through `itoa_interface/<object_type>/bulk_update` while preserving per-object preview and change records. Use `bulk_apply.sections` to restrict the batch to known-safe sections; creates, special route families, dependency merges, high-risk cleanup, and explicit operational actions keep their separate guarded paths.
- Guarded cleanup is available via `setup.sh --workflow native --mode cleanup-apply --backup-output cleanup-backup.native.yaml`. A cleanup spec must copy the current `prune-plan` `plan_id` and selected `candidate_ids`, set `cleanup.allow_destroy: true`, set `cleanup.confirm: DELETE_UNMANAGED_ITSI_OBJECTS`, and set a positive `cleanup.max_deletes`. The CLI writes the backup export before any delete call.
- High-risk cleanup candidates for `custom_content_packs`, `glass_table_icons`, and `kpi_entity_thresholds` are manual-review by default. To make them delete-eligible, rerun `prune-plan` with `cleanup.allow_high_risk_deletes: true` and `cleanup.confirm_high_risk: DELETE_HIGH_RISK_ITSI_OBJECTS`; `cleanup-apply` also requires every selected high-risk `candidate_id` to appear in `cleanup.high_risk_candidate_ids`.
- Cleanup defaults are conservative. Keyless objects, unsupported route families, and known default/shipped ITSI or content-pack objects are marked manual-review only. Set `cleanup.allow_system_objects: true` only when you intentionally want those protected candidates to become delete-eligible after reviewing the current prune plan.
- `python3 scripts/native_offline_smoke.py --spec-json <path>` exercises native preview/apply/validate/export/inventory/prune-plan plus an in-memory cleanup delete and never connects to Splunk.
- Validation diagnostics include field-level diffs for managed drift where the live object exists.
- Preview/apply/validate emit warning diagnostics for obvious KPI/correlation-search preflight issues, such as searches without explicit index constraints or threshold fields not visible in the SPL text.
- Core `entities`, `services`, and service `kpis` accept documented ITSI schema fields at the top level. Use `payload` for fields that need exact exported object shape or would conflict with local DSL keys.
- Service dependencies are merged in a second pass because dependency services must exist before they can be referenced.
- Keyed updates on the generic ITSI, Event Management, maintenance, and backup/restore route families set `is_partial_data=1` so unmanaged fields are preserved. Full-payload special routes such as `kpi_entity_threshold`, icon collection, and content-pack authorship do not use that parameter.
- Services can declare `service_template` (or `from_template`) by title or key. The workflow links through the ITSI `service/<_key>/base_service_template` endpoint and refreshes the service before dependency validation. That REST endpoint has append-only entity-rule behavior, so preview/apply call this out and operators should use the ITSI UI when they need replace or keep-existing entity-rule choices.
- `custom_threshold_window_links` links services and KPIs to a custom threshold window after services exist. Use `window` / `service` / `kpis` for title-based references, or `window_key` / `service_key` / `kpi_ids` when you already have live ITSI IDs. Links are additive; unmanaged existing links are preserved.
- Custom threshold window stop and disconnect actions are operational/destructive transitions, so they are intentionally outside the additive upsert model.
- Entities can declare `entity_type_titles`; these resolve against live `entity_type` objects or entity types created earlier in the same spec.
- Custom NEAP support accepts top-level policy fields and `payload`; both are merged into the live aggregation-policy body through the ITSI event management interface. Managed, packaged, and default NEAPs are protected from overwrite.
- Extended sections are additive/idempotent and do not delete unmanaged objects. They include entity-management policies/rules, data-integration templates, refresh queue jobs, sandboxes, sandbox services/sync logs, upgrade-readiness prechecks, summarizations/feedback, and user preferences as schema passthrough sections.
- `custom_content_packs` use the ITSI content pack authorship route. Submit and download are explicit guarded operational actions because they are lifecycle transitions, not idempotent upserts. This is separate from the `packs` installation workflow in `references/content_packs.md`.
- `event_management_states` use the core ITSI object route on tested ITSI 4.21.2 hosts. `correlation_searches`, `notable_event_email_templates`, and `neaps` use the ITSI `event_management_interface`; lookups use that route's `filter_data` request parameter rather than the core ITSI `filter` parameter. Event Management interface creates are wrapped in the documented `data` envelope; keyed updates send the object payload directly.
- `correlation_searches` can use `title` in the YAML spec for readability; the workflow writes it as the ITSI `name` field because the correlation-search schema uses `name` as the stable object name.
- `deep_dives` are normalized from the existing live object before update so required owner fields remain in the update payload.
- `glass_table_icons` use the ITSI icon collection API, which upserts icons in bulk. The native workflow handles that special route behind the same preview/apply/validate behavior.
- `backup_restore_jobs` are exposed for backup automation. Restore payloads can be destructive in a live ITSI environment and are rejected unless the spec sets `allow_restore: true`; that local guard is not sent to ITSI.
- `operational_actions` are explicit non-idempotent helper transitions. Supported actions are `entity_retire`, `entity_restore`, `entity_retire_retirable`, `custom_threshold_window_disconnect`, `custom_threshold_window_stop`, `kpi_threshold_recommendation`, `kpi_entity_threshold_recommendation`, `shift_time_offset`, `notable_event_group_update`, `notable_event_comment_create`, `notable_event_action_execute`, `ticket_link`, `ticket_read`, `ticket_unlink`, `episode_export_create`, `episode_export_list`, `episode_export_get`, `episode_export_download`, `episode_export_delete`, `episode_export_file_delete`, `templatize_object`, `bulk_update`, `custom_content_pack_submit`, and `custom_content_pack_download`. Each action is blocked unless it sets `allow_operational_action: true`; higher-risk actions require a second explicit guard such as `disconnect_all`, `retire_all_retirable`, `allow_episode_field_change`, `allow_notable_event_action_execute`, `allow_ticket_unlink`, `allow_episode_export_delete`, `allow_episode_export_bulk_delete`, or `allow_bulk_update`. `entity_retire_retirable` previews read `entity/count_retirable` targets when available, notable-event action execution reads action metadata before execution when available, and apply mode records helper response payloads in informational diagnostics.
- `entity_retire` and `entity_restore` accept `entity_keys` as a convenience shorthand for the documented `payload.data` list.
- Operational Event Analytics records and APIs such as notable events, notable event groups, notable event comments, ticket actions, and action execution are intentionally not modeled as idempotent upsert sections; use guarded `operational_actions` for explicit appends or transitions. Notable-event records are covered only by read-only inventory/count filters.
- `entity_filter_rule` is supported as a typed passthrough section. Relationship object types (`entity_relationship` and `entity_relationship_rule`) remain outside the managed model because Splunk documents them as unused. Entity discovery searches are read-only inventory helpers rather than managed upsert objects.
- Cleanup deletes are intentionally narrower than the prune plan. Content-pack authorship objects, glass-table icons, and KPI entity thresholds can be deleted only with the separate high-risk guard fields described above.
- The validator compares only the fields this skill manages, but reports path-level diffs for those managed fields when possible.
