# Topology Workflow

For users who are new to ITSI, this is usually the safest starter workflow:
they can describe services and dependencies in plain language, and the skill
turns that into services, KPIs, and dependency edges. Start with
`templates/beginner.topology.yaml` and `references/beginner_quickstart.md` before
using exported or advanced ITSI payloads.

The topology workflow combines the existing native and content-pack flows with a
top-level service-tree DSL:

- `bash scripts/setup.sh --workflow topology --spec <path>`
- `bash scripts/setup.sh --workflow topology --spec <path> --apply`
- `bash scripts/validate.sh --workflow topology --spec <path>`
- `bash scripts/setup.sh --workflow topology --spec <path> --mode prune-plan --output topology-prune-plan.json`
- `bash scripts/setup.sh --workflow topology --spec <path> --mode cleanup-apply --backup-output cleanup-backup.native.yaml`
- `python3 scripts/topology_glass_table.py --spec-json <path> --output topology-glass.native.yaml --output-format yaml`

Topology specs can include all native sections from `references/native_itsi.md`, including extended ITSI objects such as teams, entity types, KPI base searches, service templates, custom content packs, correlation searches, Event Analytics configuration, maintenance windows, backup jobs, glass tables/icons, deep dives, and home views.

Use `topology_glass_table.py` to generate a starter native `glass_tables` section from `topology.roots`. The generated payload is intentionally a reviewable starter layout, not a replacement for the ITSI visual editor.

## Node Rules

- A node must declare exactly one of `service_ref` or `service`.
- `service_ref` can be either:
  - a plain live title string, or
  - `{ profile: <pack profile>, title: <logical pack service title> }`
- `service` creates or updates a concrete service instance by title.
- `from_template` is only valid with `service` and must use:
  - `{ profile: <pack profile>, title: <logical pack template title> }`
- Child edges can optionally declare `kpis`; if omitted, the parent depends on all child KPIs.
- Shared services are reused with `{ ref: <id> }`.

## Resolution Rules

- Pack-relative names honor the pack `prefix` when resolving live ITSI services and service templates.
- Preview resolves pack-relative services and service templates from the content-pack `preview` response if they are not live yet.
- Apply and validate use live ITSI objects for service, KPI, and template linkage checks.
- Existing services that declare `from_template` are relinked through the ITSI `service/<_key>/base_service_template` REST endpoint.

## Validation Rules

- Missing node ids, duplicate ids, missing `ref` targets, self-dependencies, and cycles fail immediately.
- Explicit `kpis` on an edge must match live KPI titles on the child service for apply and validate.
- Normal preview/apply/validate only adds or updates managed services, template links, and dependencies.
- `prune-plan` and guarded `cleanup-apply` reuse the native cleanup model. The topology workflow expands `topology.roots` into desired service titles first, including pack-prefix candidates for `service_ref` nodes, so topology-only services are not reported as unmanaged just because they are absent from the top-level `services` section.
