# Splunk Cisco App Navigator (SCAN) Setup Automation

Automates the **Splunk Cisco App Navigator** (`splunk-cisco-app-navigator`).

SCAN is a management and catalog app, not a data-ingestion TA. It provides a
unified product catalog UI for 93+ Cisco products, ecosystem intelligence
dashboards, and 42+ saved searches for catalog analysis. It does **not** create
indexes, configure data inputs, or require vendor-specific credentials.

## Package Model

**Local package in `splunk-ta/` is the primary install source.**
This app does not currently have a Splunkbase listing. Use `splunk-app-install`
with a local package path:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-app-install/scripts/install_app.sh \
  --source local --file splunk-ta/splunk-cisco-app-navigator-scan_1024.tar.gz
```

For Splunk Cloud (ACS), upload as a private app. After installation, use this
skill to verify the catalog, run the initial sync, and validate the deployment.

## Agent Behavior — Credentials

**The agent must NEVER ask for passwords, API keys, or secrets in chat.**

Splunk credentials are read automatically from the project-root `credentials` file
(falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`). If neither exists, guide the user to create it:

```bash
bash skills/shared/scripts/setup_credentials.sh
```

SCAN requires **no vendor-specific secrets**. The S3 bucket used for catalog sync
(`is4s.s3.amazonaws.com`) is publicly readable. The only credentials needed are
for the Splunk management REST API.

## Environment

Setup and validation use the Splunk search-tier REST API and can run from any
host with network access to the Splunk management port (`8089`). Catalog sync
requires outbound HTTPS to `is4s.s3.amazonaws.com`.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Search-tier API | `SPLUNK_SEARCH_API_URI` env var (legacy alias: `SPLUNK_URI`) |
| Cloud stack | `SPLUNK_CLOUD_STACK` for Cloud installs (`SPLUNK_PLATFORM` is only an override for hybrid runs) |
| App name | `splunk-cisco-app-navigator` |
| Credentials | Project-root `credentials` file (falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`) |
| Skill scripts | `skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/` (relative to repo root) |

### Remote Splunk Connection

To run against a remote Splunk instance:

```bash
export SPLUNK_SEARCH_API_URI="https://splunk-host:8089"
```

## Splunk Authentication

Scripts read Splunk credentials from the project-root `credentials` file (falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`) automatically.
No environment variables or command-line password arguments are needed:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

If credentials are not yet configured, run the setup script first:

```bash
bash skills/shared/scripts/setup_credentials.sh
```

## Setup Workflow

SCAN is a catalog app with no indexes, no data inputs, and no account
configuration. Setup is simpler than typical data-ingestion TAs.

### Step 1: Install App

```bash
bash skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/setup.sh
```

Installs the app from `splunk-ta/`, verifies it is visible in Splunk Web,
and confirms the product catalog loads via REST.

For Splunk Cloud, install the package as a private app through ACS first,
then run setup.sh for post-install verification.

### Step 2: Initial Catalog Sync (Optional)

To trigger an immediate sync of products.conf and the Splunkbase lookup
from S3 (requires outbound HTTPS to `is4s.s3.amazonaws.com`):

```bash
bash skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/setup.sh --sync
```

This runs `| synccatalog dryrun=false` and `| synclookup` via the Splunk
REST API. Without `--sync`, the app's daily scheduled search handles
this automatically.

### Step 3: Validate

```bash
bash skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

Checks: app installation, app version, product catalog stanza count,
Splunkbase lookup, S3 sync connectivity, saved searches, and scheduled
sync job status.

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `products.conf` | Product catalog with 93+ Cisco product stanzas |
| `scan_splunkbase_apps.csv.gz` | Synced Splunkbase ecosystem lookup |
| `synccatalog` | Custom search command: syncs products.conf from S3 |
| `synclookup` | Custom search command: syncs Splunkbase CSV from S3 |
| 42+ saved searches | Catalog analysis, gap analysis, compatibility, migration |
| Ecosystem Intelligence | Dashboard Studio analytics dashboard |

## Dashboard

The **Ecosystem Intelligence** dashboard is a Dashboard Studio view included in
the package. It appears in Splunk Web automatically after installation — no
import or manual activation step is needed.

To access it: **Apps → Splunk Cisco App Navigator → Ecosystem Intelligence**

SCAN does not collect data, so the dashboard visualizes catalog metadata
rather than time-series events. It does not require index configuration or
data input enablement.

If the dashboard appears blank after installation, trigger an initial catalog
sync:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-scan-setup/scripts/setup.sh --sync
```

On **Splunk Cloud**, the dashboard is available immediately after the ACS
private app upload completes.

## Key Learnings / Known Issues

1. **No indexes or inputs**: SCAN is a catalog/management app. It does not
   create indexes, configure data inputs, or ingest data. This makes setup
   significantly simpler than other Cisco TAs.
2. **S3 outbound connectivity**: The `synccatalog` and `synclookup` commands
   require HTTPS access to `is4s.s3.amazonaws.com`. If the search head cannot
   reach S3, catalog sync will fail but the app still functions with its
   shipped default catalog.
3. **synccatalog dryrun is required**: Despite `searchbnf.conf` marking
   `dryrun` as optional, the Python command errors if `dryrun` is omitted.
   Always pass `dryrun=true` or `dryrun=false` explicitly.
4. **min_app_version gating**: The S3 products.conf may include a
   `min_app_version` header. If the installed app version is below this
   threshold, `synccatalog` skips the update. Upgrade the app first.
5. **SHC replication**: `server.conf` includes `products` in SHC conf
   replication so catalog updates propagate across cluster members.
6. **Lookup replication denied**: `distsearch.conf` excludes the large
   `scan_splunkbase_apps.csv.gz` from search-head replication. Each SHC
   member must run `synclookup` independently (or use the scheduled search).
7. **No Splunkbase listing**: Install from the local package in `splunk-ta/`.
   For Splunk Cloud, upload as a private app.
8. **Restart behavior**: SCAN does not create indexes, so a restart is
   typically only needed if Splunk requires one after app installation.
9. **Non-atomic sync**: `synccatalog` writes the file before reloading.
   A failure after write but before reload leaves the file updated on disk
   without Splunk seeing the changes. Run `| synccatalog dryrun=true` or
   POST to the `_reload` endpoint to recover.
10. **cisco-product-setup dependency**: The `cisco-product-setup` skill
    reads the SCAN tarball at build-time to generate `catalog.json`. At
    runtime, live SCAN features (installed app detection, data flow
    validation, legacy debt auditing) require the app to be installed.
