  Use when configuring Cisco Data Fabric federated search or standalone Splunk
  Federated Search. Render, preflight, apply, and validate the full product
  surface: Federated Search for Splunk (FSS2S, type=splunk) in standard or
  transparent mode with multiple providers and federated indexes per render,
  Federated Search for Amazon S3 legacy/reviewed provider payloads
  (FSS3, type=aws_s3, Splunk Cloud Platform only), plus Data Management app
  readiness handoffs for current Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and Azure
  Databricks federation, file-based apply for Splunk
  Enterprise standalone search heads or SHC deployers, REST-based apply that
  works on Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, the global federated-search
  enable/disable switch, and a status helper that reports per-provider
  connectivityStatus. Use as the first route for Cisco Data Fabric requests
  involving cross-domain search, federated analytics, S3 data-lake search, or
  querying data where it resides.

# Splunk Federated Search Setup

This skill prepares the Splunk Federated Search product surface across remote
Splunk platform deployments, Amazon S3 data lakes, and current Data Management
app federation handoffs. It renders reviewable assets before any apply phase
and never embeds secrets in the rendered files.

For newer Cisco Data Fabric wording, this is the first-class federated search
route. Data Fabric is broader Splunk Platform architecture; route edge/ingest
pipeline work to Edge Processor, Ingest Processor, or the SPL2 pipeline kit,
and route AI Toolkit / MCP work to their dedicated skills.

Covered:

- **Federated Search for Splunk (FSS2S)** — `type = splunk` providers in
  standard or transparent mode, with multiple providers per render and one
  or more federated indexes per provider. Supports all four documented
  deployment combinations (SE↔SE, SC↔SC, SE↔SC, SC↔SE).
- **Federated Search for Amazon S3 (FSS3)** — `type = aws_s3` providers
  rendered as REST payloads for tenants still using the reviewed legacy
  provider model (Splunk Cloud Platform only; FSS3 cannot be configured via
  `federated.conf`).
- **Data Management app federation handoff** — readiness notes for the current
  connection/dataset model for Amazon S3 plus Controlled Availability
  Microsoft Azure and Azure Databricks federation. These are UI/entitlement
  handoffs until a stable public API contract is available.
- **Global federated-search switch** — enable or disable Federated Search
  for the entire deployment via
  `/services/data/federated/settings/general`.
- **REST apply path** — works on both Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud
  Platform without shell access on the target.
- **Live status helper** — REST GET of providers and indexes with
  per-provider `connectivityStatus`, output sanitized so no password
  material is printed.

## Agent Behavior

Never ask for the federated provider service-account password (FSS2S) or for
the Splunk admin password used by the REST apply path in chat. Use local-only
secret files:

```bash
# FSS2S service-account password (one per provider, listed in the spec):
bash skills/shared/scripts/write_secret_file.sh /tmp/federated_provider_password

# REST apply admin password (used by apply-rest.sh and status.sh):
bash skills/shared/scripts/write_secret_file.sh /tmp/splunk_admin_password
```

Collect non-secret values in `template.example`: provider names, remote
management endpoints, service-account usernames, provider modes, federated
index names, dataset types and names, app contexts, AWS account IDs, AWS
regions, Glue databases, S3 paths, KMS key ARNs, and SHC replication choice.

## Quick Start

### Single provider (back-compat single-flag CLI)

```bash
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --mode standard \
  --remote-host-port remote-sh.example.com:8089 \
  --service-account federated_svc \
  --provider-name remote_prod \
  --federated-index-name remote_main \
  --dataset-type index \
  --dataset-name main
```

### Multi-provider via YAML spec

```bash
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --spec skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/template.example \
  --output-dir splunk-federated-search-rendered
```

### Apply file-based (standalone search head)

```bash
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --spec my-fss-spec.yaml \
  --phase apply \
  --apply-target search-head
```

### Apply through SHC deployer

```bash
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --spec my-fss-spec.yaml \
  --phase apply \
  --apply-target shc-deployer
# Operator then runs: splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target https://<member>:8089
```

### Apply via REST (Splunk Enterprise OR Splunk Cloud)

```bash
export SPLUNK_REST_URI=https://search-head.example.com:8089
export SPLUNK_REST_USER=admin
export SPLUNK_REST_PASSWORD_FILE=/tmp/splunk_admin_password
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --spec my-fss-spec.yaml \
  --phase apply \
  --apply-target rest
```

The REST apply POSTs each FSS2S provider, each FSS3 provider, and each
federated index. On HTTP 409 (already exists) it re-POSTs to the keyed
endpoint to update the existing entity in place.

### Global federated-search toggle

```bash
# Required env: SPLUNK_REST_URI, SPLUNK_REST_USER, SPLUNK_REST_PASSWORD_FILE
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --phase global-toggle \
  --global-toggle disable
```

### Live status

```bash
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/setup.sh \
  --phase status
# Or after rendering:
bash skills/splunk-federated-search-setup/scripts/validate.sh --live
```

## What It Renders

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `federated.conf.template` | One `[provider://X]` stanza per FSS2S provider, with per-provider password placeholder |
| `indexes.conf` | One `[federated:X]` stanza per FSS2S federated index |
| `server.conf` | `[shclustering] conf_replication_include.indexes = true` for SHC deployer use |
| `aws-s3-providers/<name>.json` | REST payload per reviewed legacy FSS3 provider, plus an AWS prerequisites README |
| `data-management-federation-handoff.md` | Current Data Management app federation handoff for Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and Azure Databricks |
| `apply-search-head.sh` | File-based apply on a standalone Enterprise SH |
| `apply-shc-deployer.sh` | File-based apply through the SHC deployer bundle |
| `apply-rest.sh` | REST apply for Splunk Enterprise OR Splunk Cloud |
| `global-enable.sh` / `global-disable.sh` | Toggle the global federated-search switch |
| `status.sh` | REST GET per provider, prints `connectivityStatus` |
| `preflight.sh` | Local btool sanity checks |
| `metadata.json` | Machine-readable plan summary, including warnings |

Read `reference.md` before choosing standard vs transparent mode and before
mixing FSS2S deployment combinations.
