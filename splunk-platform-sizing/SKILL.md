# Splunk Platform Sizing

This skill turns a stated use case into a concrete Splunk sizing across four
deployment families:

1. **All-In-One (S1)** single-server standalone.
2. **Distributed** Splunk Validated Architectures (C1 / C3 / M-series).
3. **Splunk on Kubernetes** - Splunk Operator (`s1`/`c3`/`m4`) and Splunk POD
   (`pod-small`/`pod-medium`/`pod-large`).
4. **Splunk Cloud** (ingest + workload guidance; Splunk-managed).

The skill is **offline and advisory**: it needs no Splunk connection and no
credentials. It renders a Markdown report and a `sizing.json` to a gitignored
directory. All numbers are planning estimates, not a substitute for a Splunk
Professional Services sizing.

## How To Use It

Collect the use case, then run the calculator. Ask only for non-secret
planning values: daily ingest (GB/day), searchable retention (days), search
load (concurrent searches or users), whether premium apps (Enterprise
Security, ITSI) are in scope, and whether high availability is required.

Render a sizing (writes `sizing-report.md` + `sizing.json`):

```bash
bash skills/splunk-platform-sizing/scripts/setup.sh \
  --daily-ingest-gb 500 \
  --retention-days 90 \
  --workload-profile es \
  --concurrent-searches 24 \
  --ha
```

All-In-One check for a small, low-search shop:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-platform-sizing/scripts/setup.sh \
  --daily-ingest-gb 80 \
  --retention-days 30 \
  --deployment-target standalone
```

Size for Splunk on Kubernetes with SmartStore:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-platform-sizing/scripts/setup.sh \
  --daily-ingest-gb 1200 \
  --workload-profile es_itsi \
  --ha \
  --smartstore \
  --deployment-target sok
```

Print the JSON without writing files (good for piping):

```bash
bash skills/splunk-platform-sizing/scripts/setup.sh \
  --daily-ingest-gb 300 --deployment-target cloud --dry-run --json
```

## Inputs

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--daily-ingest-gb` | Daily ingest volume (required). |
| `--retention-days` | Searchable retention in days (default 90). |
| `--workload-profile` | `core`, `es`, `itsi`, or `es_itsi` (premium multipliers). |
| `--search-density` | `light`, `medium`, `dense` search concurrency. |
| `--concurrent-searches` / `--concurrent-users` | Search load. |
| `--ha` | Require high availability (indexer/search-head clustering). |
| `--replication-factor` / `--search-factor` | Override clustered RF/SF. |
| `--multisite` / `--sites` | Multisite (geo) cluster and site count. |
| `--smartstore` | Plan for SmartStore remote object storage. |
| `--growth-pct` | Growth headroom percent (default 15). |
| `--deployment-target` | `auto`, `standalone`, `distributed`, `sok`, `pod`, `cloud`. |

With `--deployment-target auto` (the default) the engine recommends standalone
when the use case is All-In-One eligible, otherwise distributed.

## What It Computes

- **Indexer count** from `effective_ingest / per-indexer ceiling`, where the
  ceiling depends on the workload profile and search density. Floored to the
  clustering minimum when HA is requested.
- **Search head count** from concurrent searches, promoting to a search head
  cluster when more than one is needed or HA is requested. Premium apps
  (Enterprise Security, ITSI) add dedicated search heads.
- **Storage** = ingest x compression (~50%) x retention x replication factor,
  split across indexers, with a SmartStore local-cache note when enabled.
- **Reference hardware** per role (vCPU / RAM / IOPS).
- **All-In-One eligibility** gate with explicit reasons when standalone is not
  viable.

It then maps the result onto each deployment target (SVA category, SOK
architecture, POD profile, Cloud workload tier) and emits hand-offs.

## Hand-off Contracts

The report ends with hand-offs to the skills that actually deploy what was
sized:

- Standalone or distributed install ->
  [`splunk-enterprise-host-setup`](../splunk-enterprise-host-setup/SKILL.md)
- Indexer cluster ->
  [`splunk-indexer-cluster-setup`](../splunk-indexer-cluster-setup/SKILL.md)
- Search head cluster ->
  [`splunk-search-head-cluster-setup`](../splunk-search-head-cluster-setup/SKILL.md)
- Splunk on Kubernetes (SOK / POD) ->
  [`splunk-enterprise-kubernetes-setup`](../splunk-enterprise-kubernetes-setup/SKILL.md)
- Retention / SmartStore indexes.conf ->
  [`splunk-index-lifecycle-smartstore-setup`](../splunk-index-lifecycle-smartstore-setup/SKILL.md)
- Splunk Cloud indexes and stack ->
  [`splunk-cloud-acs-admin-setup`](../splunk-cloud-acs-admin-setup/SKILL.md)

## Out of Scope

- Live ingest discovery from the Monitoring Console (bring the GB/day figure).
- License sizing/quotas (use `splunk-license-manager-setup`).
- Forwarder fleet sizing (use `splunk-deployment-server-setup` /
  `splunk-agent-management-setup`).
- Exact Splunk Cloud SVC pricing; the Cloud output is workload guidance only.
