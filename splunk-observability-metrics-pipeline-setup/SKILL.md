# Splunk Observability Metrics Pipeline Setup

Focused Metrics Pipeline Management wrapper over
`splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows`. It renders reviewable MPM intent
and downstream specs; broader ingestion pipeline work still belongs to OTel
Collector, Edge Processor, Ingest Processor, or SPL2 pipeline skills.

```bash
bash skills/splunk-observability-metrics-pipeline-setup/scripts/setup.sh --render \
  --name "Checkout metric cardinality review" \
  --metric service.request.duration \
  --action aggregate \
  --realm us1
```
