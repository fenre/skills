# Splunk AppDynamics Platform Setup

Render-first owner for AppDynamics self-managed platform workflows. Platform
mutations are high-blast-radius and require reviewed runbooks; Enterprise
Console changes are additionally gated by `--accept-enterprise-console-mutation`.
The skill tracks the current AppDynamics On-Premises 26.4 Enterprise Console
and Controller documentation for CLI-capable platform work.

```bash
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-platform-setup/scripts/setup.sh --render
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-platform-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

The renderer emits:

- `platform-topology-inventory.yaml` with the reviewed component and host map.
- `deployment-method-selector.yaml` and `deployment-method-matrix.md` to route
  users across classic On-Premises, Virtual Appliance, GUI, CLI, and
  discover/upgrade paths without making them know the product taxonomy first.
- `enterprise-console-command-plan.sh` with session-safe Enterprise Console CLI
  commands for platform, credential, host, version, diagnosis, and job discovery.
- `classic-onprem-deployment-runbook.md`,
  `controller-install-upgrade-runbook.md`, `component-deployment-runbook.md`,
  `virtual-appliance-deployment-runbook.md`, `platform-ha-backup-runbook.md`,
  and `platform-security-checklist.md` for support-gated or outage-prone work.
- `virtual-appliance-vmware-inventory.yaml`,
  `virtual-appliance-ovftool-plan.sh`, `virtual-appliance-govc-plan.sh`, and
  `virtual-appliance-vmware-validation.sh` for vSphere or standalone ESXi OVA
  deployment handoff without passing VMware passwords on shell command lines.
- `platform-validation-probes.sh` for local static checks and optional live
  reachability probes.

First-class deployment coverage:

- Classic On-Premises Enterprise Console Express GUI, Custom GUI, CLI, and
  Discover/Upgrade GUI/CLI flows.
- Classic component installers for Linux Events Service, Windows Events Service
  manual deployment, EUM Server GUI/console/silent installer modes, and
  Synthetic Server dependency sequencing.
- Virtual Appliance infrastructure targets for VMware vSphere, VMware ESXi,
  Microsoft Azure, AWS, KVM, and ROSA. The VMware path includes OVF Tool and
  govc dry-run plans, OVA placement guidance, OVF property inspection, three
  node network inventory, and `appdctl show boot` validation.
- Virtual Appliance Standard and Hybrid service deployment with `appdcli`
  validation handoffs.
