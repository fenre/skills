# Splunk KV Store Admin Setup

This skill renders and applies Splunk App Key Value Store (KV Store)
administration assets. It is render-first because backup, restore, clean,
migrate, and upgrade operations change durable state; review the rendered host
scripts before applying.

## Agent Behavior

Never ask for the Splunk admin password in chat. Lifecycle operations run as
the splunk user on the host after `splunk login`; collection governance uses the
project `credentials` file via the shared helper. Restore and clean are
destructive and refuse to run without their acceptance flag.

Read `reference.md` before any restore, migrate, or upgrade. Always take a
point-in-time backup first.

## Splunk Enterprise 10.4 guardrails

Enterprise **10.4** removes legacy MongoDB 4–6 binaries bundled with older KV
Store releases. Do **not** upgrade directly from Splunk **9.x** to **10.4**;
route through **10.0** or **10.2** first so KV Store reaches MongoDB 7+.

On **10.x → 10.4**, MongoDB **8** is applied automatically during the Splunk
upgrade. After upgrade, run `status.sh` or `splunk show kvstore-status --verbose`
and confirm `serverVersion` reflects the expected MongoDB 8 train before
collection governance or restore work.

Cloud stacks on doc train **10.4.2603** inherit the same KV Store behavior on
the Splunk-managed side; Enterprise operators still own the upgrade ladder on
self-managed hosts.

## Quick Start

Render the lifecycle assets:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-kvstore-admin-setup/scripts/setup.sh --topology shc
```

Take a point-in-time backup live:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-kvstore-admin-setup/scripts/setup.sh --phase apply --operation backup --point-in-time true
```

Restore (destructive, captain on SHC):

```bash
bash skills/splunk-kvstore-admin-setup/scripts/setup.sh --phase apply --operation restore \
  --backup-archive-name kvdump_2026.tar.gz --accept-kvstore-restore
```

Define a KV Store collection + lookup definition live via REST:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-kvstore-admin-setup/scripts/setup.sh --phase apply --operation collections \
  --collection-name asset_inventory --collection-fields ip:string,risk:number \
  --lookup-definition-name asset_inventory_lookup
```

## What It Renders

- `backup.sh` / `restore.sh` / `clean.sh` / `migrate.sh` / `upgrade.sh` / `status.sh` / `preflight.sh`
- `server.conf` with optional `[kvstore] kvstoreUpgradeOnStartupEnabled = false`
- `collections.conf` and `transforms.conf` KV Store lookup-definition templates

## Operations

- `backup` - `splunk backup kvstore [-pointInTime true]`
- `restore` - `splunk restore kvstore -archiveName <file>.tar.gz` (gated)
- `clean` - `splunk clean kvstore --local|--cluster` (gated)
- `migrate` - SHC `start-shcluster-migration kvstore -storageEngine wiredTiger`
- `upgrade` - SHC `start-shcluster-upgrade kvstore -version <v>`
- `collections` - write collection + lookup definition via REST

Hand SHC replication health, captain transfer, and KV Store reset coordination
to `splunk-search-head-cluster-setup`.
