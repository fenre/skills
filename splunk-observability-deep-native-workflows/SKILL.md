# Splunk Observability Deep Native Workflows

Use this skill for native Observability Cloud product workflows where the
operator experience matters as much as the underlying API object. It complements:

- `splunk-observability-otel-collector-setup` for telemetry collection.
- `splunk-observability-dashboard-builder` for classic dashboard API payloads.
- `splunk-observability-native-ops` for detectors, teams, muting rules,
  Synthetics API payloads, APM topology/trace checks, and simple RUM/log handoffs.
- `splunk-observability-database-monitoring-setup` for DBMon collector wiring.
- `splunk-observability-k8s-frontend-rum-setup` for Browser RUM and Session
  Replay instrumentation injection.
- `splunk-observability-mobile-rum-setup` for native iOS/Android, React
  Native, and Flutter RUM instrumentation used by Mobile RUM and DXA.
- `splunk-observability-cloud-integration-setup` for Log Observer Connect,
  Related Content, Dashboard Studio O11y metrics, and SIM add-on streams.
- `splunk-observability-otel-collector-setup`, `splunk-edge-processor-setup`,
  `splunk-ingest-processor-setup`, and `splunk-spl2-pipeline-kit` for
  collection-side or Splunk Platform pipeline changes behind telemetry pipeline
  management requests.

The default workflow is render-first and non-mutating. This skill produces a
reviewable workflow packet: coverage report, deeplinks, UI handoff steps, and
API action plans for surfaces with documented public APIs.

## Coverage Model

Every rendered item gets a coverage status:

- `api_apply`: a documented public Observability API can create or update the
  object. This skill renders the action plan; run live apply only through the
  specific owning skill or an approved apply client.
- `api_validate`: a documented public API can read, validate, or download data
  for the workflow.
- `delegated_apply`: another repo skill owns the apply path.
- `deeplink`: the skill renders deterministic Observability UI links and
  preserves filter context.
- `handoff`: the product surface is UI-guided or app-side; the skill renders
  exact operator steps.
- `not_applicable`: the requested workflow does not apply to the selected
  product, edition, realm, or instrumentation state.

Do not claim `api_apply` for modern dashboard layout, RUM session replay
playback, DBMon explain-plan UI, Synthetic waterfall detail, Trace Analyzer
search UI, or the Observability Cloud mobile app unless a public API is verified
for that exact action.

## Safety Rules

- Never ask for Splunk Observability API tokens, RUM tokens, mobile app
  credentials, database passwords, session replay consent secrets, or Splunk
  Platform credentials in conversation.
- Never pass tokens or passwords on the command line or as environment-variable
  prefixes.
- This skill does not need token files for rendering. If a downstream owning
  skill applies an API plan, use that skill's `--token-file` or file-backed
  credential flags.
- Reject inline secret fields such as `token`, `api_token`, `access_token`,
  `password`, `client_secret`, `secret`, and direct `*_token` values. Use
  file-reference fields in downstream specs instead.
- Treat session replay as privacy-sensitive. Always include consent, retention,
  masking/sensitivity, replay enablement, and enterprise-subscription checks in
  handoffs.

## Primary Workflow

1. Identify product surface and target workflow:
   - Modern dashboard composition, sections, tabs, logs charts, metrics charts,
     service-map panels, dashboard templates, or demos.
   - APM service map, service view, endpoint dashboards, Trace Analyzer, trace
     waterfall, RUM/log/span links, Tag Spotlight, business transactions,
     AlwaysOn Profiling, MetricSet prerequisites, or Database Query Performance
     in APM.
   - RUM session search, replay playback, browser or mobile replay
     instrumentation checks, crashes/errors, source maps, URL grouping, mobile
     app health dashboards, or RUM/APM linking.
   - Digital Experience Analytics (DXA) projects, event definitions, element
     picker planning, user segments, conversion funnels, time-series analyses,
     source mapping, or RUM instrumentation prerequisites.
   - Splunk Database Monitoring query details, explain plans, query samples,
     query metrics, trace correlation, infrastructure correlation, or AI
     Assistant handoff.
   - Synthetic browser/API/uptime workflows, Try Now/Run Now, waterfall,
     HAR/video/filmstrip artifacts, or RUM/APM correlation.
   - SLO creation, validation, targets, compliance windows, breach/error-budget/
     burn-rate alert rules, or SLO dashboards.
   - Infrastructure Monitoring, Kubernetes entities, Network Explorer, Related
     Content pivots, or AI Assistant investigations.
   - Metrics Pipeline Management (MPM) / telemetry pipeline management planning
     for metric cardinality, real-time versus archived metrics, dropping,
     aggregation rules, or downstream collector and SPL2 pipeline handoffs.
   - Splunk Observability Cloud for Mobile dashboards, alerts, push
     notifications, sharing, and on-call handoff.

2. Copy `template.example` and fill in non-secret values only.

3. Render and validate:

   ```bash
   bash skills/splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows/scripts/setup.sh \
     --render --validate \
     --spec skills/splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows/template.example \
     --output-dir splunk-observability-deep-native-rendered
   ```

4. Review:
   - `coverage-report.json` for per-surface API-vs-UI status.
   - `deeplinks.json` for direct Observability UI entry points.
   - `apply-plan.json` for public API validation or apply actions.
   - `workflow-handoff.md` for operator steps and downstream skill handoffs.
   - `payloads/` for SLO API payloads, modern dashboard intents, DB query
     investigation intents, Synthetic artifact intents, and RUM replay checks.

5. Apply only through the owning skill or approved apply client:
   - Classic dashboards -> `splunk-observability-dashboard-builder`.
   - Detectors, teams, muting rules, Synthetics tests -> `splunk-observability-native-ops`.
   - Browser RUM instrumentation -> `splunk-observability-k8s-frontend-rum-setup`.
   - DBMon collection -> `splunk-observability-database-monitoring-setup`.
   - LOC, Dashboard Studio O11y metrics, SIM inputs -> `splunk-observability-cloud-integration-setup`.
   - On-Call mobile paging and incident response -> `splunk-oncall-setup`.

  Management (MPM): metric usage, MTS/cardinality review, keep/archive/drop
  routing, aggregation rule planning, routing exceptions, limitations, and
  handoffs to OTel Collector, Edge Processor, Ingest Processor, or the SPL2
  pipeline kit for broader telemetry pipeline management.
- `related_content`: APM, Infrastructure, Log Observer Connect, Kubernetes,
  database, host, trace, and log pivots plus metadata/entity-index checks.

  filters, alert visualizations, sharing, and push notification/on-call handoff.
- `log_observer_chart`: modern logs chart workflow using SPL1, SPL2, or JSON
  query intent inside the new dashboard experience.

Aliases remain supported for usability: `dxa` and `digital_experience` resolve
to `digital_experience_analytics`; `mpm`, `metric_pipeline_management`, and
`telemetry_pipeline_management` resolve to `metrics_pipeline_management`. Older
surface names such as `rum_session_replay`, `rum_mobile`, `synthetic_waterfall`,
`infrastructure_navigator`, and `log_observer_chart` remain first-class and are
not renamed.

[reference.md](reference.md).

## Output Contract

Rendered packets must contain:

- `metadata.json`
- `coverage-report.json`
- `apply-plan.json`
- `deeplinks.json`
- `workflow-handoff.md`

If a workflow includes `payload`, `intent`, `logs`, `privacy`, `slo`, or
artifact fields, the renderer writes the normalized form under `payloads/`.

## Useful Commands

Validate a spec without writing a new packet:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows/scripts/setup.sh \
  --validate \
  --spec skills/splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows/template.example
```

Render with an explicit realm:

```bash
bash skills/splunk-observability-deep-native-workflows/scripts/setup.sh \
  --render --validate \
  --realm us1 \
  --spec my-deep-native-workflows.yaml \
  --output-dir splunk-observability-deep-native-rendered
```

Use `--json` in CI to emit machine-readable validation or render summaries.
