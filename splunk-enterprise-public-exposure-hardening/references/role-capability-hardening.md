# Role and Capability Hardening Reference

The renderer creates a custom `role_public_reader` from zero (it does
NOT inherit from `user`) and explicitly disables every high-risk
capability. This document explains why each capability is on the
removed list.

## High-risk capabilities removed from non-admin roles

| Capability | Risk on a public surface |
|---|---|
| `edit_cmd` | SVD-2026-0302 RCE driver. Lets non-admin users define new external commands. |
| `edit_cmd_internal` | Variant of `edit_cmd` for internal commands. |
| `edit_scripted` | SVD-2025-0702 RCE. Lets non-admin users define scripted inputs. |
| `rest_apps_management` | Mutate app catalog via REST. |
| `rest_apps_install` | Install Splunkbase apps via REST. |
| `rest_properties_set` | Mutate any conf via REST. |
| `run_collect` | `| collect` writes index data; can pollute indexes. |
| `run_mcollect` | Same for metrics. |
| `run_debug_commands` | Internal debug SPL surface. |
| `run_msearch` | Map-search; resource-amplifying. |
| `run_sendalert` | Alert actions can spawn arbitrary scripts. |
| `run_dump` | `| dump` writes to disk. |
| `run_custom_command` | Custom external commands gated here. |
| `embed_report` | Lets the user create unauthenticated dashboard embeds. |
| `change_authentication` | Self-service password change without admin. |
| `delete_by_keyword` | `| delete`; can destroy data. |
| `accelerate_search` | Lets users create accelerated data models. |
| `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` | Search heads forwarding REST to indexers. |
| `import_apps` / `install_apps` | Same risk as `rest_apps_install`. |
| `edit_authentication` | Alter `authentication.conf`. |
| `edit_user` | Self-service user edit. |
| `edit_roles` | Privilege escalation via role edit. |
| `edit_token_*` | Token issuance / revocation. |
| `edit_indexer_*` | Indexer mutation. |
| `edit_input_*` | Input mutation. |
| `edit_modinput_*` | Modular input mutation (RCE class). |
| `edit_search_scheduler` | Schedule searches that the role wouldn't otherwise. |
| `edit_remote_apps_management` | Mutate apps on remote peers. |
| `pattern_detect` | Resource-amplifying ML command. |
| `request_pstacks` | Request internal stack traces (info disclosure). |
| `request_remote_tok` | Issue tokens for remote search heads. |

## Default Splunk roles and their inheritance

- `admin` — full access. Two break-glass admins; rename / disable
  stock `admin`.
- `power` — has `schedule_search`, `edit_user`, `edit_search_scheduler`.
  Should NOT be used for public-facing accounts.
- `user` — has `change_authentication`, `embed_report`,
  `change_own_password`. Inheriting from `user` would import
  capabilities the public reader should not have, hence
  `role_public_reader` is built from zero.
- `can_delete` — has `delete_by_keyword`. Never on a public-facing role.

## Search-time guardrails (per role)

| Setting | Default | Hardened | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `srchTimeWin` | unlimited | 86400 (24h) | Max time-range per search |
| `srchDiskQuota` | 100 MB | 100 MB | Per-user disk for search artifacts |
| `srchJobsQuota` | 3 | 3 | Concurrent searches |
| `rtSrchJobsQuota` | 6 | 0 | Real-time searches (turn off) |
| `cumulativeSrchJobsQuota` | 50 | 50 | Across searches |
| `cumulativeRTSrchJobsQuota` | 100 | 0 | Across RT searches |
| `srchMaxTime` | 1800s | 300s | Per-search runtime |
| `srchIndexesAllowed` | `*` | explicit list | Sigma-restricted |
| `srchIndexesDisallowed` | unset | `_audit;_internal;_introspection;_telemetry` | Hide platform indexes |
| `srchIndexesDefault` | `*` | first allowed index | Default search target |

## `[role_admin] never_lockout = disabled`

Splunk ships `role_admin` with `never_lockout = enabled`. This is
unacceptable for any public surface — it means the most-targeted
account has no per-user lockout protection.

The renderer's `authorize.conf` overrides:

```
[role_admin]
never_lockout = disabled
```

After applying, validate via `preflight.sh` (which fails closed if it
sees `never_lockout = enabled`).

## Premium apps capability overlay

When ES, SOAR, ITSI, UBA, ARI, AA, Mission Control, Content Packs,
or SSE are installed alongside this skill's hardening app, those
apps add capabilities that the base `role_public_reader` does not
know about. See
[premium-apps-capability-overlay.md](premium-apps-capability-overlay.md)
for the two-tier audit (embedded list + runtime scan) and the JSON
form at
[premium-apps-capability-overlay.json](premium-apps-capability-overlay.json).

The rendered preflight (step 23) automatically detects installed
premium apps and emits WARN-level guidance. The ES-8.4-specific
`list_inputs` capability is treated as ERROR-not-WARN if removed
from any role per Splunk's own warning.

## SPL package upload surface

There is no `enable_install_apps` toggle in any released Splunk
version (this is a common misconception). The skill closes the upload
surface in two layers:

- Capability layer (`authorize.conf`): `install_apps`,
  `import_apps`, `rest_apps_install`, `rest_apps_management`, and
  `edit_remote_apps_management` are all `disabled` on
  `role_public_reader`.
- Reverse-proxy layer: the rendered nginx and HAProxy templates deny
  `/services/apps/local`, `/services/apps/appinstall`, and
  `/services/apps/remote` at the edge regardless of authentication
  state.

For SHC deployments, app rollouts go through the deployer's
`shcluster/apps/` directory and the SHC bundle apply — not through
Splunk Web upload.

## Authentication tokens vs SSO

Splunk authentication tokens (JWT) bypass SSO. The public reader role
should NOT have `edit_token_*`. Tokens for automation should be issued
to dedicated service accounts with scoped capabilities.

## Capability-check validation

`validate.sh` and `preflight.sh` query
`/services/authorization/capabilities` and refuse the deployment if any
of the high-risk capabilities are enabled on a non-admin role.
