| Product | Splunkbase | Package ID | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PSC Linux 32-bit | `2884` | `Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python_linux_x86` | Legacy only; not a modern install target |

| Smart Alerts Assistant for Splunk (beta) | `6415` | `Smart_Alerts_Assistant` | Legacy beta/migration-only |

## AI Toolkit Feature Coverage

The coverage report must include these surfaces:

- package install and version compatibility
- PSC dependency selection and install order
- ML-SPL commands: `fit`, `apply`, `summary`, `score`, `listmodels`,
  `deletemodel`, and the AI Toolkit `ai` command
- AI Toolkit 5.7.4 compatibility with PSC 4.3.2, Python 3.13 PSC runtime,
  and the current supported Splunk platform matrix
- ML command permissions, algorithm access, search safeguards, and performance
  cost settings
- Smart Assistants and Experiment Management for prediction, clustering,
  outlier detection, forecasting, and anomaly workflows
- Cisco Deep Time Series forecasting and anomaly detection readiness in AI
  Toolkit `5.7.4`
- Hosted foundation model readiness for Foundation-Sec, Cisco Deep Time Series
  Model, and GPT-OSS where available inside the Splunk Platform boundary
- Connections tab readiness for LLM providers and container endpoints
- Container Management tab readiness for DSDL-backed workflows
- model object inventory, lookup permissions, and retraining risk after the
  MLTK `5.3.0` model compatibility break
- ONNX upload/apply readiness
- external LLM/provider handoffs for OpenAI-compatible endpoints, AWS Bedrock,
  AWS SageMaker inference, and local/private model endpoints
- alerting handoffs for searches that use trained models or anomaly outputs

## DSDL Feature Coverage

The coverage report must include these surfaces:

- DSDL app install and setup page readiness
- DSDL API endpoint, runtime health, and container logs/readiness checks
- container environment selection: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, HPC, GPU,
  air-gapped image registry, or generic handoff
- DSDL API endpoint and container health handoff
- JupyterLab notebook development and model export flow
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP, graph analytics, forecasting, RAG/LLM, and custom
  algorithm examples as operator coverage, not pre-created app state
- image provenance, registry mirror, TLS, RBAC, storage, resource quota, and
  notebook/model governance checks
- HEC and Splunk Observability handoff for runtime telemetry and inference
  output where applicable
- one-to-one DSDL app to container environment warning for older DLTK/DSDL sync
  collision behavior

## Generated Artifact Contract

`scripts/render_assets.py` writes:

- `coverage-report.json` and `coverage-report.md`
- `apply-plan.json`
- `doctor-report.md`
- `dsdl-runtime-handoff.md`
- `legacy-anomaly-migration.md`

Every coverage entry has:

- `key`
- `title`
- `status`
- `source_url`
- `summary`
- `owner`

Allowed statuses:

- `planned`
- `validated`
- `delegated`
- `manual_handoff`
- `eol_migration`
- `blocked`
- `not_applicable`

The renderer and validator must never emit `unknown`.

## Compatibility Defaults

- Default PSC target for render-only plans is `linux64`; override with
  `--psc-target windows64`, `mac-intel`, or `mac-arm` when the search head OS
  is known.
- Splunk Cloud search heads use Linux PSC.
- Live Enterprise installs should prefer explicit `--psc-target` unless the
  operator has separately confirmed the search head OS.
- AI Toolkit `5.7.4` and PSC `4.3.2` are the current audited pair.
- Live install commands intentionally omit `--app-version` so
  `splunk-app-install` pulls the latest compatible Splunkbase release; the
  audited version values in this reference are validation metadata, not pins.
- DSDL `5.2.3` supports Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud package delivery,
  but external runtime setup remains a handoff.
