# Cisco Talos Intelligence Setup

## TA Completion Gate

For every TA/add-on or dashboard companion run, satisfy the shared
[TA completion gate](../shared/ta_completion_gate.md): configure and enable the
data ingest path owned by this skill or its required companion, validate events
or metrics in the target indexes/source types, and verify any
pre-built/package-shipped dashboards are visible, macro-aligned, and returning
data. If the package ships no dashboards, record that evidence explicitly and
hand off dashboard use to the consuming app, ES/ITSI/ARI content, or readiness
doctor.

Automates readiness checks for Cisco Talos Intelligence for Enterprise Security
Cloud (`Splunk_TA_Talos_Intelligence`, Splunkbase `7557`).

This is not a normal polling input add-on. The package provides:

- a custom `/query_reputation` REST handler
- `get_talos_enrichment` capability
- adaptive response actions for collection and enrichment
- an encrypted Talos service account certificate/private-key stanza
- a disabled Talos IP blacklist threatlist

## Support Posture

Treat this as ES Cloud-first. Splunk documents the app for supported Splunk
Enterprise Security Cloud deployments, ES `7.3.2+`, and non-FedRAMP
environments.

Do not ask the user for the Talos service account certificate/private key in
chat. Splunk Cloud normally provisions the service account material; this skill
validates its presence and fingerprint.

## Workflow

Install and create the optional collection index:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-talos-intelligence-setup/scripts/setup.sh --install
```

Validate readiness:

```bash
bash skills/cisco-talos-intelligence-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

Only use file-based service account injection for explicit diagnostics:

```bash
bash skills/shared/scripts/write_secret_file.sh /tmp/talos_service_account.pem
bash skills/cisco-talos-intelligence-setup/scripts/configure_service_account.sh \
  --service-account-file /tmp/talos_service_account.pem
```

The IP blacklist threatlist stays disabled unless the user explicitly enables it.
