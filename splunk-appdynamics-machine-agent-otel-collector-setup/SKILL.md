  Render, validate, preflight, apply, and rollback the bundled OpenTelemetry
  Collector that runs with AppDynamics Machine Agent combined mode. Use when the

  infrastructure visibility, AppDynamics collector YAML, local OTLP 4317/4318

# Splunk AppDynamics Machine Agent OTel Collector Setup

Owns the AppDynamics Machine Agent bundled OTel Collector configuration. The
default is loopback-only OTLP reception, traces to Splunk Observability Cloud
and AppDynamics OTel, metrics to Splunk Observability Cloud, and logs disabled
unless a log destination is explicitly declared.

```bash
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-machine-agent-otel-collector-setup/scripts/setup.sh --render
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-machine-agent-otel-collector-setup/scripts/setup.sh --apply preflight --spec collector.yaml
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-machine-agent-otel-collector-setup/scripts/setup.sh --apply collector --spec collector.yaml --accept-host-mutation
bash skills/splunk-appdynamics-machine-agent-otel-collector-setup/scripts/validate.sh --output-dir splunk-appdynamics-machine-agent-otel-collector-setup-rendered
```

## What This Skill Covers

- Machine Agent combined mode for Linux RPM, Linux ZIP, Docker, and Windows ZIP
  layouts.
- Bundled collector config rendering with OTLP gRPC on `127.0.0.1:4317` and
  OTLP HTTP on `127.0.0.1:4318` by default.
- Splunk Observability token-file and AppDynamics API key-file placeholders.
- Collector service/container restart, OTLP port checks, exporter health probes,
  backup manifests, and rollback.

## Guardrails

- `--accept-host-mutation` is required before writing files or restarting the
  collector.
- `--accept-remote-execution` is required for SSH targets.
- Direct token, access-token, and API key flags are refused; use file-backed
  fields in the spec.
- Mutation is refused when the expected bundled collector path or service or
  container name cannot be confirmed from the spec and preflight.
