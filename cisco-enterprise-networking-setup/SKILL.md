# Cisco Enterprise Networking App Setup Automation

Automates the **Cisco Enterprise Networking for Splunk Platform**
(`cisco-catalyst-app`).

## Package Model

**Pull from Splunkbase first (latest version), fall back to `splunk-ta/`.**
Use `splunk-app-install` with `--source splunkbase --app-id 7539` to get the
latest release. If Splunkbase is unavailable, fall back to the local package
in `splunk-ta/`. This applies to both Splunk Cloud (ACS) and Splunk Enterprise.
The shared installer enforces the required Cisco Catalyst Add-on dependency and
installs `TA_cisco_catalyst` (Splunkbase ID `7538`) first when it is missing,
so the visualization app is not deployed by itself. The Cisco Catalyst
Enhanced Netflow Add-on (`splunk_app_stream_ipfix_cisco_hsl`, Splunkbase ID
`6872`) is optional and should only be installed when the user wants the extra
NetFlow-focused dashboards.

After installation, use this skill to configure macros, saved searches,
acceleration, and validation over search-tier REST. Any `splunk-ta/_unpacked/`
tree is review-only.

This is a **visualization app** — it provides dashboards and saved searches but
does not collect data. The dashboards visualize data collected by the companion
**Cisco Catalyst Add-on** (`TA_cisco_catalyst`). Some additional dashboards
also use the optional **Cisco Catalyst Enhanced Netflow Add-on**
(`splunk_app_stream_ipfix_cisco_hsl`). Use the `cisco-catalyst-ta-setup` skill
for Cisco Catalyst TA configuration and the
`cisco-catalyst-enhanced-netflow-setup` skill when the user wants the optional
NetFlow-focused dashboards.

## Agent Behavior — Credentials

**The agent must NEVER ask for passwords or secrets in chat.**

Splunk credentials are read automatically from the project-root `credentials` file
(falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`). If neither exists, guide the user to create it:

```bash
bash skills/shared/scripts/setup_credentials.sh
```

The agent may freely ask for non-secret values: index names, macro settings, etc.

### Optional NetFlow Prompt

Before planning optional NetFlow dashboard coverage, the agent should ask the
user whether they want the additional NetFlow-focused dashboards enabled.

If the user says yes:

1. Use the `cisco-catalyst-enhanced-netflow-setup` skill to install and validate
   the optional Cisco Catalyst Enhanced Netflow Add-on.
2. Confirm whether a NetFlow/IPFIX ingestion path already exists.
3. If NetFlow ingestion is not already in place, guide the user to the
   `splunk-stream-setup` workflow so the receiver path can be installed and
   configured before expecting those dashboards to populate.

## Environment

Setup and validation use the Splunk search-tier REST API and can run from any
host with network access to the Splunk management port (`8089`). In Splunk
Cloud, stack-level restarts are handled through ACS instead of the search-tier
REST endpoints.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Search-tier API | `SPLUNK_SEARCH_API_URI` env var (legacy alias: `SPLUNK_URI`) |
| Cloud stack | `SPLUNK_CLOUD_STACK` for Cloud installs (`SPLUNK_PLATFORM` is only an override for hybrid runs) |
| App name | `cisco-catalyst-app` |
| Credentials | Project-root `credentials` file (falls back to `~/.splunk/credentials`) |
| Skill scripts | `skills/cisco-enterprise-networking-setup/scripts/` (relative to repo root) |

### Remote Splunk Connection

To run against a remote Splunk instance:

```bash
export SPLUNK_SEARCH_API_URI="https://splunk-host:8089"
```

## Prerequisites

The Cisco Catalyst Add-on (`TA_cisco_catalyst`) must be installed and
configured before this app can display data. A `splunk-app-install` run for app
ID `7539` auto-installs app ID `7538` when needed. The Cisco Catalyst Enhanced
Netflow Add-on (`splunk_app_stream_ipfix_cisco_hsl`) is optional for additional
NetFlow-focused dashboards and should be offered to the user explicitly rather
than installed by default.

## Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Update Index Macro

The app uses the `cisco_catalyst_app_index` macro to know which indexes to
search. This must match the indexes configured in the TA.

```bash
bash skills/cisco-enterprise-networking-setup/scripts/setup.sh
```

This updates `cisco_catalyst_app_index` to include all four product indexes:
`catalyst`, `ise`, `sdwan`, `cybervision`.

Partial runs: `--macros-only`, `--custom-indexes "idx1,idx2,idx3"`.

### Step 2: Enable Saved Searches

The app has 5 saved searches that build lookup tables. The setup script enables
them by default:

| Saved Search | Schedule | Lookup Built |
|---|---|---|
| `cisco_catalyst_location` | Hourly | `cisco_catalyst_ise_location.csv` |
| `cisco_catalyst_sdwan_netflow` | Daily | `cisco_catalyst_sdwan_application_tag` (KV) |
| `cisco_catalyst_sdwan_policy` | Daily | `cisco_catalyst_sdwan_policy_mapping` (KV) |
| `cisco_catalyst_meraki_organization_mapping` | Daily | `meraki_org_id_name_lookup.csv` |
| `cisco_catalyst_meraki_devices_serial_mapping` | Daily | `cisco_catalyst_meraki_device_serial_mapping.csv` |

### Step 3: Offer Optional Enhanced Netflow Support

Ask the user whether they want the optional NetFlow-focused dashboards. If they
do, use the `cisco-catalyst-enhanced-netflow-setup` skill to install and
validate `splunk_app_stream_ipfix_cisco_hsl` (Splunkbase ID `6872`), and make
sure the NetFlow/IPFIX ingestion path is configured, typically via the
`splunk-stream-setup` workflow.

### Step 4: Enable Data Model Acceleration (Optional)

```bash
bash skills/cisco-enterprise-networking-setup/scripts/setup.sh --accelerate
```

Enables acceleration on the `Cisco_Catalyst_App` data model for faster
dashboard loading.

If Splunk Cloud later reports `restartRequired=true`, use
`acs restart current-stack` instead of trying to restart the deployment through
the search-tier REST API.

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
bash skills/cisco-enterprise-networking-setup/scripts/validate.sh
```

Checks: app installation, macros, saved searches, data model, data presence.

## Macros

| Macro | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cisco_catalyst_app_index` | `index IN ("main")` | Tells dashboards which indexes to search |
| `cisco_catalyst_app_sourcetypes` | `sourcetype IN ("cisco:ise*", "cisco:sdwan*", "cisco:dnac*", ...)` | Filters to known Cisco sourcetypes |
| `summariesonly` | `summariesonly=false` | Controls data model acceleration usage |

The setup script updates `cisco_catalyst_app_index` to:
```
index IN ("catalyst", "ise", "sdwan", "cybervision")
```

## Dashboards

The app ships all dashboards in the package. No import or manual activation
step is required — they appear in Splunk Web automatically after installation.

To access them: **Apps → Cisco Enterprise Networking for Splunk Platform**

| Dashboard | Description |
|---|---|
| Overview | High-level summary across all products |
| Network Insights | Network health and topology |
| Security Insights | ISE and security posture |
| Events And Incident Viewer | Event timeline and drill-down |
| Endpoints (Clients) | Client/endpoint details |
| Users And Applications | User and application activity |
| Performance | Network performance metrics |
| Sensors | Sensor and device telemetry |

**Prerequisites for dashboards to show data:**

1. `cisco_catalyst_app_index` macro must be updated (Step 1 in the setup workflow).
2. At least one of `catalyst`, `ise`, `sdwan`, or `cybervision` indexes must
   be receiving data from the companion `TA_cisco_catalyst`.
3. The 5 lookup-building saved searches (Step 2) must have run at least once.
4. For NetFlow-focused dashboards, the optional Enhanced Netflow Add-on must
   be installed and Splunk Stream must be configured as a NetFlow receiver.

On **Splunk Cloud**, dashboards are immediately available after ACS installs
the app. The macro update and saved search enablement happen over search-tier
REST and require no additional Cloud-specific steps.

Dashboard forms use the `cisco_catalyst_app_index` macro for index selection.
If data is present but dashboards show no results, verify the macro value
includes all data-bearing indexes.

## MCP Server Integration

```bash
bash skills/cisco-enterprise-networking-setup/scripts/load_mcp_tools.sh
```

## Key Learnings / Known Issues

1. **Macro alignment**: The `cisco_catalyst_app_index` macro MUST include all
   indexes configured in the TA, or dashboards will show no data.
2. **Data model acceleration**: Enable for production; keep disabled during
   initial setup/testing.
3. **Saved searches**: The lookup-building saved searches should run at least
   once before dashboards referencing those lookups will populate.
4. **No inputs here**: This app only visualizes. Base data collection belongs
   in `TA_cisco_catalyst`, and optional NetFlow parsing belongs in
   `splunk_app_stream_ipfix_cisco_hsl` when that path is enabled.
5. **No `configure_account.sh`**: Unlike the TA skills, this app does not
   collect data and has no add-on accounts to configure. Account and input
   setup belongs in the companion TA workflow, especially the
   `cisco-catalyst-ta-setup` skill for `TA_cisco_catalyst`.
