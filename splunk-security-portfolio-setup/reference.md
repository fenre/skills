# Splunk Security Portfolio Coverage

`last_verified: 2026-05-26`

The first-class coverage target is the public Splunk Products security row:
Enterprise Security, Security Essentials, SOAR, User Behavior Analytics,
Attack Analyzer, and Asset and Risk Intelligence.

Current ES 8.x branding also gets explicit resolver coverage for native SOAR,
Security AI Assistant / AI Assistant in Security, and Federated Analytics so
operators do not have to know the older skill names before routing work.

## Product Coverage

## Associated Security Offerings
